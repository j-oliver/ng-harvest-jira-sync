You need to be logged in to your Harvest & JIRA account upfront. If so it will list you all worklogs you did in Harvest & JIRA for today - if the worklogs match in JIRA-Ticket, duration & exact comment they will be considered a match and listed in one line. You can navigate back and forth in time to also compare past days.

If an entry is only present in Harvest you will get offered a one-click-sync to JIRA - but only if the Harvest comment begins with a valid JIRA Ticket Nr followed by a ":" or "space".

Wishlist for the future:
- Definitely move the base urls for Harvest & JIRA to a chrome extension settings page. At the moment Device Insight Harvest & JIRA Urls are still hardcoded. This must change in a future release to make the base urls configurable and this tool usable for all Harvest & Jira users - not only Device Insight.
- Potentially a syncing back to Harvest option. This is a bit more complex as we need to select a concrete Harvest Project to book this efford to.
- Potentially some input fields to make the time tracking directly in the chrome extension popup and save it to both Harvest & JIRA.
