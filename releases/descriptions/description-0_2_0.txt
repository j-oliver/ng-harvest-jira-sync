Save a lot of time every day syncing your Harvest worklogs to JIRA by using this browser extension!
You need to be logged in to your Harvest & JIRA account upfront. If so the extension popup will list you all worklogs you did in Harvest & JIRA for today - if the worklogs match in JIRA-Ticket, duration & exact comment they will be considered a match and listed in one line. You can navigate back and forth in time to also compare past days.

If an entry is only present in Harvest you will get offered a one-click-sync to JIRA - but only if the Harvest comment begins with a valid JIRA Ticket Nr followed by a ":" or "space". There is also a convenience button for syncing all entries of a day at once.

Changelog:
* Current Version 0.2.0
  - navigating back and forward in time faster (added +-7 days button)
  - sync all entries of a day button if more than 1 entry was found for syncing
  - provided more icons - so the icon is also shown in the chrome://extensions overview

* Version 0.1
  - base version allowing all basic syncing single entries to JIRA

Wishlist for the future:
- Definitely move the base urls for Harvest & JIRA to a chrome extension settings page. At the moment Device Insight Harvest & JIRA Urls are still hardcoded. This must change in a future release to make the base urls configurable and this tool usable for all Harvest & Jira users - not only Device Insight.
